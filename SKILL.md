## Core Philosophy

Mary Barra's path: 34 years from co-op student to CEO

> "Do every job you're in like you're going to do it for the rest of your life, and demonstrate that ownership of it. You don't want to be renting the job, you want to be owning the job."

The principle: **Own every role. Build breadth. Never stay too long.**

Barra never stayed in the same role more than four years. She moved from engineering to HR to product development to supply chain. Each role was fully owned, not treated as a stepping stone.

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Path Analysis

**1.1 Study Successful Predecessors**
- How did previous leaders reach the top role?
- What experiences were common?
- What functions are typically represented?
- Is the organization biased toward certain paths (finance, operations, product)?

**1.2 Identify Your Gaps**
- What functions have you not led?
- What scale have you not managed?
- What types of challenges have you not faced?
- Where is your credibility weakest?

**1.3 Map the Critical Experiences**
- What experiences are "must have" for the target role?
- What experiences differentiate candidates?
- What timing constraints exist?

### Step 2: Phase 2: Role Selection Strategy

**2.1 Prioritize Breadth Over Depth**
- Seek roles in functions you have not led
- Cross-functional roles build generalist perspective
- Staff roles (executive assistant, strategy) provide broad visibility

**2.2 The Four-Year Rule**
- Stay long enough to own outcomes (2-3 years minimum)
- Leave before stagnation sets in (4 years maximum)
- Each role should be a complete story with demonstrated impact

**2.3 Take Unexpected Roles**
- HR when you are an engineer
- Plant manager when you are in corporate
- Staff role when you have been in line management
- The unusual path demonstrates adaptability

### Step 3: Phase 3: Ownership Mindset

**3.1 Own It Like Forever**
- Approach each role as if you will do it for the rest of your career
- Do not treat roles as stepping stones
- Build lasting improvements, not quick wins for resume

**3.2 Demonstrate Impact**
- What measurable outcomes did you achieve?
- What did you build that outlasted your tenure?
- What was different because you were there?

**3.3 Build Relationships Across Functions**
- Your future success depends on cross-functional credibility
- Relationships built in each role become your network
- Reputation follows you; earn it in every role

### Step 4: Phase 4: Visibility and Development

**4.1 Strategic Visibility**
- Which assignments put you in front of senior leadership?
- What problems, if solved, would be noticed?
- How do you demonstrate judgment under pressure?

**4.2 Developmental Assignments**
- What stretch assignments accelerate readiness?
- What crisis or turnaround experience is available?
- What international or cross-geography exposure is possible?

**4.3 Mentorship and Sponsorship**
- Who can provide coaching on blind spots?
- Who can advocate for you in succession discussions?
- Who will give you honest feedback?

### Step 5: Phase 5: Final Positioning

**5.1 Executive Readiness**
- What final experiences complete your profile?
- What demonstration of enterprise thinking is needed?
- How do you show board-level perspective?

**5.2 Succession Positioning**
- How are succession decisions made in your organization?
- What is the timeline for the target transition?
- What competitors exist and what are their gaps?

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Desired role not available | Seek adjacent role or cross-functional alternative |
| Asked to stay longer than 4 years | Negotiate transition or seek external options |
| Organization favors external hires | Build external visibility while maintaining internal excellence |
| Blocked by current manager | Address directly; escalate if necessary; may require external move |
| Target role has no clear successor | This is an opportunity; position yourself explicitly |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:**
```
Current role: VP Engineering, 3 years, major product launch delivered
Target role: CEO (10-15 year horizon)
Experience gaps: No P&L ownership, no HR/people leadership, no international experience
Organizational context: Last 3 CEOs were insiders from operations and product; finance path less common
```

**Output:**

## Insider Succession Development Plan

### Gap Analysis
| Experience | Current | Required | Priority |
|------------|---------|----------|----------|
| P&L ownership | None | Essential | HIGH |
| People/HR leadership | None | Differentiating | HIGH |
| International | None | Expected | MEDIUM |
| Board exposure | Limited | Essential | HIGH |
| Crisis management | Limited | Expected | MEDIUM |

### Role Sequence (10-Year Plan)

| Years | Role | Purpose | Exit Criteria |
|-------|------|---------|--------------|
| 0-3 (current) | VP Engineering | Complete current tenure | Successful product launch; strong team built |
| 3-6 | SVP Operations + P&L | Gain P&L ownership; operational breadth | Demonstrated profit improvement |
| 6-8 | SVP HR or Chief People Officer | People leadership; culture experience | Major HR initiative completed |
| 8-10 | Regional President (International) | P&L at scale; international experience | Region performance improvement |
| 10+ | COO or EVP | Enterprise leadership; board exposure | Positioned for CEO succession |

### Ownership Approach
Each role: "Do it like you're doing it for the rest of your life"
- Build lasting systems, not quick wins
- Leave each role better than you found it
- Create successors who credit your development of them

### Key Relationships to Build
- Current CEO: Mentorship and visibility
- Board members: Through strategic projects
- HR SVP: For future people leadership credibility
- International leaders: For geographic expansion

### Critical Assignments to Seek
- Lead a turnaround (demonstrates crisis capability)
- Chair a cross-functional initiative (demonstrates enterprise thinking)
- Present to board (demonstrates executive presence)
